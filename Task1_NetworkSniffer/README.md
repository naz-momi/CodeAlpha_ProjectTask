# Task 1: Basic Network Sniffer (CodeAlpha Internship)

This project was created during my internship at **CodeAlpha** under the role of **Cybersecurity Intern**.  
The goal was to build a Python-based network packet sniffer that captures and analyzes live network traffic in real-time.

---

##  Objective
- Capture network packets (live) using a custom-built Python script.
- Analyze headers and payloads to understand traffic flow.
- Simulate traffic using tools like Nmap and verify detection.

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3
- scapy (packet crafting and sniffing)
- Nmap (for testing traffic)
- Wireshark (for result comparison)



python3 sniffer.py

Ensure you have scapy installed:

pip install scapy



## Learning Outcomes

Learned how packet headers (IP, TCP/UDP) are structured.

Understood raw socket handling and packet interception.

Developed hands-on skills with scapy for cybersecurity purposes.
